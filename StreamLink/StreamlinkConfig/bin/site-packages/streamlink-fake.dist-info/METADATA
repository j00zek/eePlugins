Streamlink is a CLI utility which pipes video streams from various services into a video player, such as VLC.

The main purpose of streamlink is to avoid resource-heavy and unoptimized websites, while still allowing the user to enjoy various streamed content.

Streamlink is a fork of the [Livestreamer][livestreamer] project.

Please note that by using this application you're bypassing ads run by
sites such as Twitch.tv. Please consider donating or paying for subscription
services when they are available for the content you consume and enjoy.
